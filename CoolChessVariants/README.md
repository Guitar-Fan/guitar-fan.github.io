-Tired Chess:
Pieces get tired after moving the piece moves a certain number of moves in a row. When tired, pieces get disabled for 1 turn, then counter resets.

Objective: Checkmate, Capture King

-Quantum Chess:
Superposition: Most pieces can move to two squares at once, entering a quantum state.

Collapse: An attack on one of a piece's quantum positions forces it to the other. An attack on both captures it.

Quantum Tunnel: Once per game, a piece can "tunnel" through an adjacent piece.

Goal: Standard checkmate. The King's quantum state must be fully trapped.
