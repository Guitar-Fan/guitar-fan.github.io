Our flagship polyphonic synthesizer built with Rust + WebAssembly:
- Plugin Architecture: Extensible audio processing system
- Professional Synthesis: Multi-voice polyphony with ADSR envelopes
- Advanced Filtering: Low/High/Band Pass filters with resonance control
- Real-time Control: Responsive parameter adjustment and visualization
- Preset System: Professional presets with instant recall
- Modern UI: Sleek interface with spectrum analysis and waveform display

## üéõÔ∏è Core DAW Tools

Web Browser DAW (`Chromebook_DAW/chromebook_daw.html`):  
Multi-track audio workstation with recording, editing, mixing, and export capabilities. Upload and play multiple audio files, record via microphone, split/copy/paste clips, quantize, fade, normalize, reverse, and export. Includes mixer view with volume, pan, and EQ per track.

MIDI DAW (`MIDI_Daw_With_Ideas.html`):  
MIDI-based workstation with built-in synthesizer. Upload MIDI files and play with native synth. Custom sampling: upload your own audio samples and the system automatically pitch-shifts and maps them across the keyboard for MIDI playback.

## üîß Audio Processing Tools

EQ Tool (`EQ.html`):  
Professional equalizer with real-time frequency band adjustment. Upload audio files and modify frequency regions with adjustable bands. Right-click to create new bands and change shapes (low shelf, high shelf, bell). Export your EQ'd audio.

Parameter Audio Editor (`ParameterAudioEditor.html`):  
Comprehensive audio editor with visualization, EQ tweaking, envelope shaping, and pitch adjustment. Upload, visualize, edit, and export as WAV.

Wavetable Synth (`Wavetable_Synth.html`):  
Modern wavetable synthesizer for sound design and synthesis. Create and export custom sounds as WAV files.

Reverb Tool (`reverb.html`):  
Dedicated reverb effect processor for spatial audio enhancement.

Reverb Collection (`reverb-collection.html`):
Collection of reverb effects and spatial audio tools.

WebAudio DAW Tools (`WebAudioDAWTools.html`):  
Collection of Web Audio API utilities and tools for development.

## üß™ WebAssembly Reverb Engines

C++ Reverb Engine (`wasm-tests/cpp-reverb/`):  
High-performance reverb effects compiled from C++ to WebAssembly for professional audio processing.

Hibiki Reverb (`wasm-tests/hibiki-reverb/`):  
Advanced reverb algorithms with WebAssembly acceleration.

Progressive Reverb (`wasm-tests/prog-reverb/`):  
Modern reverb processing with customizable parameters.

Rust Audio Synth (`wasm-tests/rust-audio-synth/`):  
Complete audio synthesis framework built in Rust with WebAssembly compilation.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. For the main audio synthesizer:
   ```bash
   cd wasm-tests/rust-audio-synth
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Open: http://localhost:8080/rust-wasm-audio-synth-studio.html
   ```

2. For other tools: Open HTML files directly in a modern web browser

## üéØ Browser Compatibility

All tools are designed to work locally on Chromebooks and modern web browsers using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly (no server required).
