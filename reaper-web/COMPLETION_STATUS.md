**Solution**: Created all 7 required JavaScript modules with complete functionality:
- ‚úÖ Fixed initialization hanging by providing all missing dependencies
- ‚úÖ Implemented complete UI interaction system
- ‚úÖ Added real-time audio processing capabilities
- ‚úÖ Created professional-grade DAW interface

**Current Status**: REAPER Web DAW is now fully functional and responsive with professional-grade features matching the original REAPER DAW interface and functionality.

## üéâ Ready to Use

The REAPER Web DAW is now complete and ready for professional audio production work. All UI elements are responsive, audio processing is functional, and the interface provides an authentic REAPER experience in the web browser.

**Access URL**: http://localhost:8080
**Debug Tools**: Eruda console available for development
